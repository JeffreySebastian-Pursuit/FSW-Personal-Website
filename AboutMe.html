      <p>
        I am a Full Stuck Developer at Pursuit, fascinated by creating an
        application that would benefit other people in different countries.
        Back home in the Philippines, people are struggling with pursuing their
        education due to a lack of resources.
        Therefore, I decided to pursue Software Engineering to help the less
        fortunate get jump-started on their careers. <br />
        Through Pursuit, I gained my skills includes HTML, CSS, Javascript,
        Node, Express, React/Redux, PostgreSQL, Sprints, Agile, Code Reviews,
        and Pair Programming. Pursuit, an intensive 12 - month software
        engineering fellowship with a 9% acceptance rate.
